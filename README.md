###### To clone into your system.

## Adding Variables to your Environment

Loading your environment variables from a `.env` file is as easy as "ABC"!

##### A. Create your `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and insert
your key/value pairs in the following format of `KEY=VALUE`:

```sh
VITE_BACKEND_DOMAIN_BASE_URL = http://localhost:8080/
VITE_BACKEND_DOMAIN_BASE_URL_API = http://localhost:8080/api/
VITE_FRONTEND_DOMAIN_BASE_URL = http://localhost:3575/
```

## To run the project

In the project directory, you can run:

```bash
npm | pnpm run dev
```

## FYI

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3575](http://localhost:3575) which is custom port set by me to view project in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes and save the code.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
